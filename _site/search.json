    "text": "Ecology is the basis of some of the most compelling stories about the world around us – the patterns of diversity that determine the structure of alpine forests to coastal tidepools are best described in ecological terms using observational, experimental, and theoretical methods. As an instructor in the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology, I have three main teaching goals to teach these fundamental methods in ecology: 1. foster an inclusive environment for discussion and critical thinking, 2. connect observations to theory and current applications, and 3. make connections between coursework and future careers."

This includes 1) understanding how organism traits influence communities and ecosystems, 2) how mathematical tools can be used to understand and predict population and community dynamics, and 3) how humans shape these processes. These skills are developed in a combination of individual and group projects in addition to assignments to check for understanding of these concepts throughout the quarter.\nInstitution: University of California, Santa Barbara\nLevel: Undergraduate, 4 units\nRole: Teaching Assistant\nQuarters taught: Spring 2018, Spring 2019, Spring 2020\nPlease see my CV for a complete list of courses taught."

Always seemed to know what she was doing and how to help. Grateful she would post the notes after lab!” (EEMB 179, Winter 2021)\n- “An is the best TA I have ever had. She is so vastly knowledgable, and shows obvious dedication to the course and her students. She is beyond helpful, and otherwise the only person on the planet who could keep me engaged for a three hour coding lab.” (EEMB 179, Winter 2021)\n- “An is probably my favorite TA at UCSB. She was so patient during the long labs and answered questions well. Skilled at troubleshooting problems. She replied to emails very quickly and was understanding with deadlines. I appreciate her so much and think that she will become a great professor in the future.” (EEMB 179, Winter 2021)\n- “She was well organized, gave us plenty of resources to help us succeed, and was super friendly and approachable. In addition, she explained class material well and asked useful questions that helped us learn the material ourselves.” (EEMB 120, Spring 2021)\n- “I like the way An presented her teaching as she was very clear, conscise, yet made the readings a lot easier to understand by putting it in simpler terms. She broke down each part of the readings really nicely and it helped me understand the papers a lot more.” (EEMB 120, Spring 2021)\n- “She was very friendly and clear during all of our sections. She made them enjoyable and was great at breaking awkward silences by asking followup questions or by clarifying the question she had asked.” (EEMB 120, Spring 2021)\n- “An was wonderful, even when our class was slow to answer questions (probably because it was 8am on a friday [sic]) she was always encouraging and patient. She explained concepts thoroughly and I like how calming her class was. She made a safe space to get answers wrong and open up discussions about some difficult to understand concepts.” (EEMB 120, Spring 2021)\nResponses to: “What were the TA’s strengths and/or weaknesses as a teacher?”\n- “An made sure that everyone including me understood the different parts of code and why we were doing them even when she was going too fast. I appreciate that she was willing to work with people individually in order to make them understand the topic and why we were doing what we were doing.” (EEMB 179, Winter 2020)\n- “An was very good at explaining difficult concepts in R in a way that was easy to understand for beginners but gave us the tools and foundation to tackle increasingly complex problems.” (EEMB 179, Winter 2020)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "A large part of ecosystem function in woodland systems depends on soil fungal communities. However, global climate change has the potential to fundamentally alter these communities as fungal species are filtered with changing environmental conditions. Therefore, a fundamental question is: Will fungal communities continue to provide the same functions under the stress of climate change?\nI had the privilege of being able to answer this question by working in unceded Kawaiisu territory, or the Tehachapi Mountains in south-central California with a collaborator, Dr. Devyn Orr. In this study, we examined the potential effects of climate on host-associated (i.e. tree-associated) soil fungal communities at climatically distinct sites, where more arid conditions represent likely regional climate futures. We found that soil fungal community composition changes strongly across sites, with species richness and diversity being highest at the most arid site.\n\n\n\nNMDS plot of soil fungal communities subset by degree of host association. White triangles represent arid sites, grey circles represent intermediate sites, black squares represent mesic sites.\n\n\nHowever, host association may buffer the effects of climate on community composition, as host-associated fungal communities are more similar to each other across climatically distinct sites than the whole fungal community. Lastly, an examination of functional traits for ectomycorrhizal fungi, a well-studied guild of fungal mutualist species, showed that stress-tolerant traits were more abundant at arid sites than mesic sites, providing a mechanistic understanding of these community patterns. Taken together, our results indicate that fungal community composition will likely shift with future climate change but that host association may buffer these effects, with shifts in functional traits having implications for future ecosystem function.\n\nPublications\nBui, A, D Orr, M Lepori-Bui, K Konicek, HS Young, HV Moeller. “Soil fungal community composition and functional similarity shift across distinct climatic conditions.” FEMS Microbiology Ecology. 2020."
