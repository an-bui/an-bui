## About me

I am a community ecologist at UC Santa Barbara in the Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology department. I use trait-based approaches to understand community responses to disturbance. Currently, I work in kelp forest systems focusing on algal recovery dynamics in the [Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research site](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/).
